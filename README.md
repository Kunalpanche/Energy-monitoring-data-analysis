## Overview
This project involves exploring energy consumption data to find patterns and make data-driven decisions that can help optimize energy usage. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), anomaly detection, and visualization of the findings. The goal is to create insights that can assist in managing energy more efficiently.

## Files
- `Admin_t.csv` - Data related to administrative energy consumption.
- `CSED_t.csv` - Energy consumption data from CSED building.
- `Completedenergymonitoring.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for the full data analysis and visualization.
- `ENERGY CONSUMPTION.pbit` - Power BI file for interactive data visualization.
- `design_lab_t.csv` - Energy consumption data from design labs.

## Technologies
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)
- Power BI (for advanced visualization)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kunalpanche/Energy-monitoring-data-analysis.git

2. Run the Jupyter notebook (Completedenergymonitoring.ipynb) for the analysis:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Completedenergymonitoring.ipynb
